Full code version of the site to build over time

This website functions as a resource for those who are working in the hospital to help deal with technological issues during the day-to-day use of common equipment. This is not meant to serve as strict instructions for proper use of the medical equipment. We provide basic tutorials on how to set up the equipment to get each case started and moving smoothly. Troubleshooting videos and videos on common problems is a very important resource because it may prevent a hospital from loosing thousands of dollars due to delays in proceeding with a case.

DISCLAIMER: AV Techdaddy does not provide medical services or strict tutorials on how a technology must be used but rather gives guidance and acts as a resource to healthcare professionals on basic functionality that is used daily in the operating room. It is intended for people who work in a medical setting. Any interpretation of how to use a specific device or software is our own and not affiliated with the corresponding company.
